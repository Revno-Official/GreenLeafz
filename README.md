# GreenLeafz

GreenLeafz is a Leaf Classifier which is the final project submission for CS50X by Rohit R and Venuskanda S.

The app classifies species of plants just by analysing an image of its leaf given by the user.

It is an Android App developed in Java implementing a Sequential Machine Learning Model which was designed by ourselves in Tensorflow, Python.

We carried out this project over a span of three months.

We implemented various activities like Tutorial, Know More and About Us for the flexibility of the user.

It uses some pre-implemented open-source code from GitHub to implement certain additional functionalities. 

We encountered numerous bugs in the process, which was duly fixed with the help of our fellow coders on StackOverflow, Reddit and Discord.
